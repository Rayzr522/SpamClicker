# SpamClicker
Just a simple Bukkit / Spigot plugin to disable the combat cooldown which was added in Minecraft 1.9

If you have any problems with it, just let me know. *It should work in any version of 1.9 or above*, as it doesn't use any NMS, just the Bukkit API

# Notice
I'm actually now working together with the author of OldCombatMechanics to make a more fully featured plugin, and it does what SpamClicker already does. Check it out here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/oldcombatmechanics-disable-1-9-hit-cooldown.19510/
