Just a simple Bukkit / Spigot plugin to disable the combat cooldown which was added in Minecraft 1.9

If you have any problems with it, just let me know. *It should work in any version of 1.9 or above*, as it doesn't use any NMS, just the Bukkit API

# Notice
If you've seen a plugin called OldCombatMechanics, this is not a rip-off. OldCombatMechanics is much MUCH less efficient, and so it will not run as well on your server. My plugin uses almost no code to run, just around 14 lines. Also, OldCombatMechanics only works on specific versions of 1.9, however mine should work on any 1.9 version, and even when 1.10+ comes out, it should still work.
